# Runtime Capability Contract

`container-compose` requires lower-runtime behaviour that is not available in
stock Apple releases. A source name or commit hash identifies a build, but does
not explain which contract is missing. The supported stack therefore publishes
a versioned, typed capability manifest through:

```sh
container system version --format json
container compose version --format json
```

Both commands report `runtimeCapabilitySchemaVersion` and
`runtimeCapabilities`. Compose checks these fields before every command that
needs the runtime. An absent capability, a duplicate identifier, or a schema
mismatch fails closed and names the exact problem. Additional identifiers are
accepted so a newer compatible runtime can be used safely.

## Schema And Capability Versions

The manifest schema versions the JSON contract. Increment it only for an
incompatible representation change.

Each capability identifier has its own terminal version. Increment that
version when the behaviour expected under the identifier changes
incompatibly. Add a separate identifier for an independent optional contract.
Do not silently widen an existing identifier.

The release source of truth is
`Tools/release/runtime-capabilities.json`. `make stack-consistency` verifies
that it exactly matches the typed Compose and sibling Container definitions.

## Version 1 Capabilities

| Identifier suffix | Contract covered |
| --- | --- |
| `archive-copy.v1` | Direct archive copy in both directions, metadata preservation, streaming, cancellation, and guest-path safety used by `compose cp` |
| `build-extensions.v1` | Named builders, scoped no-cache filters, SSH forwarding, attestations, external Dockerfiles, additional contexts, and checks used by `compose build` |
| `create-configuration.v1` | Typed process, mount, network, resource, namespace, security, device, and GPU configuration used when creating service and one-off containers |
| `image-filesystem.v1` | Image metadata and declared-volume discovery, image-volume copy-up, commit/export, and live snapshot behaviour |
| `lifecycle.v1` | Create/start/stop/restart/exec/attach/kill/pause/wait controls, persisted exit state, and process metadata |
| `network-scoped-aliases.v1` | Source-scoped dynamic DNS aliases used to preserve Compose link isolation and target address changes |
| `observation.v1` | Container discovery, health, logs, events, statistics, top, and network/port observation |

The manifest declares code-level support in the matched build and its pinned
stack. It does not claim that the service is running or that host resources
such as virtualisation, networking, or GPU support are available. Compose
checks service readiness separately after capability negotiation, and each
command still reports runtime or host availability errors from its actual
operation.

## Change Procedure

1. Add or revise the typed capability in `ContainerVersion` with focused
   encoding and CLI-version tests.
2. Update the Compose typed requirement and
   `Tools/release/runtime-capabilities.json` together.
3. Update the exact Container and Containerization pins.
4. Run the stack consistency gate, focused stock-Apple and matched-runtime
   preflight tests, full repository CI, and the live release gate.
5. Record the capability's upstream disposition and remove it only after an
   Apple-native equivalent is merged, consumed, and parity-tested.

## Pending Logging Capability

`io.github.stephenlclarke.container.logging-drivers.v1` is reserved for the
complete contract in the [Docker logging-driver design](docker-logging-driver-semantics-design.md).
It is intentionally absent from the required manifest while the runtime still
uses its legacy local/none writer. The capability may be published only when
the matched Container authority implements lossless requested/resolved state,
defaults, distinct built-in drivers, delivery/cache/read semantics, provider
lifecycle, independent attach, migration, and the maintained conformance gates.

Compose config and hashing never require a runtime lookup. Commands that need
advanced logging continue to fail at the existing v1 gate until this exact
identifier is negotiated; catalogue discovery is diagnostic and never replaces
authoritative create/start validation.
